In this project, I developed a Streamlit app that allows users to input any dataset and receive a comprehensive data analysis using Pandas Profiling. 
The app provides an intuitive interface for uploading datasets, after which it automatically generates a detailed exploratory data analysis report.
This report includes essential statistics, data distributions, correlations, missing values analysis, and interactive visualizations.
By leveraging Pandas Profiling, the app simplifies the data exploration process, making it accessible for users to gain quick insights and understand their data's structure and key characteristics.
This versatile tool is particularly useful for data scientists and analysts looking to streamline their initial data analysis tasks.
